		ApolloGeese represents a design philosophy, a collection of modules relevant to web development and a simple object-notation language to loosely couple them together according to the design philosophy.
	</p>
	<p>
		The current proof-of-concept implementation has been done in Mono C#.
	</p>

	<h2>Defects in modern software architecture</h2>
	<p>
		In any given software design, more than 90%* of the program flow consists of merely a handful of similar elements chained together in a hierarchical fashion, exchanging typically trivial amounts of information. Tight coupling however negates this effect and makes software projects less sustainable.<br>
		<small>* 90% of percentages are just made up</small>
	</p>	
	<h2>Creative limitations</h2>
	<p>
		By restricting the amount of intricacies a developer may introduce to a software product, and offering only very abstract components and relations, a gain in development time may be achieved. An even larger gain in quality may be achieved due to the reuse of components that have already been implemented, and tested many times thereafter.
	</p>
	<p>
		ApolloGeese/CLON aims to implement this theory using a framework and language (more on the latter, later.)
	</p> 
	<h2>Implementation</h2>
	<p>
		At the basis of the design philosophy lay Services and Interactions. Services are the active components of a software design. Interactions provide the connections over which Services may exchange data.
	</p>
	<p>
		A developer using ApolloGeese only needs to specify what Services are being used and where they should connect; underlying implementation and negotiation on the type of Interaction used, is transparent to the developer.
	</p>		
	<h3>Services</h3>
	<p>
		Services in short, provide:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Functionality.
		</li>
		<li>
			Means of initial configuration of this functionality through a constructor-like call.
		</li>
		<li>
			A single entry point used to activate the service and provide it with context produced by services that came before it.
		</li>
		<li>
			Multiple named exit points used to propagate richer context to hierarchically downstream services, by means of Interactions
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Interactions</h3>
	<p>
		Interactions in short, provide:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Hierarchy and Communications.
		</li>
		<li>
			Storage of arbitrary information on a key-value basis.
		</li>
		<li>
			Means to access and mutate information about on earlier interaction in the hierarchy.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Modules</h2>
	<p>
		About 40 Services have been development at the time of writing this, which provides a toolkit sizable enough to quickly put together most common website scenarios.
	</p>
	<p>
		A couple of modules most prevalent in software projects built using ApolloGeese/CLON
	</p>
	<h3>HTTP Server</h3>
	<p>
		Listens on one or multiple ports and prefixes for incoming HTTP requests and creates an Interaction upon each request, wherein an URL-queue, header-data and body-data exist.
	</p>
	<h3>SiteSubsection</h3>
	<p>
		Uses the URL information from previous Interactions to deviate into an appropriate branch of the program flow. Provides Interactions with the current URL-/section/ name.
	</p>
	<h3>Template</h3>
	<p>
		Uses either existing information from preceding Interactions or underlying branches to fill in template labels.
	</p>
	<h3>GetFieldReader</h3>
	<p>
		Parses the query-section of the URL, verifies this input and branches onwards depending whether or not verification was successful. It provides an Interaction with the parsed and sanitized input.
	</p>
	<h3>PostFieldReader</h3>
	<p>
		Shares many traits with the <b>GetFieldReader</b>, but instead parses and verifies the HTML POST-body into an Interaction.
	</p>	
	<h3>MySqlQuerier</h3>
	<p>
		Uses values from earlier Interactions to fill in a parameterized query. It branches for single results, each result, and no results. It provides Interactions with acquired row values, if any.
	</p>

	<h2>Connecting Services</h2>
	<p>
		It would be most easy to settle with the philosophy and the modules, and to couple them together using existing development platforms such as Python, C# or Java. You could do this, it would however come with two disadvantages:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Existing languages come with a payload of features we don't require here
		</li>
		<li>
			The temptation would arise to implement irresponsibly tight couplings like we're used to doing with these languages.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>CLON</h3>
	<p>
		Aside from sounding like an STD capable of traveling through space, CLON is the language that aims to tackle these issues by being:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Light and simple</li>
		<li>Like, Really simple</li>
		<li>Strictly object oriented</li>		
	</ul>
	<p>
		CLON is short for 'C-Like Object Notation', and shares some traits with JSON
	</p>
	<p>
		CLON may be used to string ApolloGeese services together, like we did for this website as follows:
